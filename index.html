          <h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-heart"></span><a name="story"></a> Our Story</h2>
          <p>We always say that although we met through an online dating website, we could have easily met each other through the tight-knit network of Chicago climbing friends, some of whom we already had in common.</p>
          
          <p>Be that as it may, Katherine saw Mike's profile and thought he was cute, and the fact that he was a climber tipped the scale. So, she "winked" at him. Mike saw the wink, and although he normally ignored "winks" on that site, the fact that she was cute and a climber tipped the scale, so he wrote her an email.</p>
		  
          <p>Our first date was the 4th of July, 2006. We immediately recognized each other as good people and quickly became friends. Fast forward 8 years, countless hours spent together traveling in cars and planes, hundreds of climbs and hikes, and nights spent under the stars, that intimate friendship grew into a deep relationship of respect, caring, and love. We're so thrilled to have our family and friends come to bless our future together.</p>

          <h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span><a name="party"></a> Wedding Party</h2>
		  
          <h3>Maid of Honor</h3>
          <p><b>Liz Henderson, Sister of the Bride.</b>  My big sister is my mentor, role model, and best friend. I'm honored to have her stand next to me while I take this important step in my life. She gives the best advice and has been supportive of everything I've ever done. She's also an amazing mom to my adorable niece and nephew, Abby and David.</p>
		  
          <h3>Bridesmaids</h3>
          <p><b>Niamh O'Connor, Cousin of the Bride.</b> Niamh wins for travelling the furthest for this wedding party, all the way from Dublin! The love I have for this lady goes beyond your typical cousin relationship. She's another rock in my life who, no matter the distance, has always been there for me. She's a wicked cook, has a spitfire sense of humor, and has the warmest of hearts. From our days turning cartwheels in Granny's backyard to our raucous party days, Niamh has always been my partner in crime.</p>
          <p><b>Maya Schenwar, Friend of the Bride.</b> Maya and I forged our friendship on the hard steel of freshman Honors Biology. Throughout high school and beyond, Maya has been a shining light in my life. With her dazzling intellect, generosity of spirit, and endearing goofiness, she's the best company in any situation.</p>
          <p><b>Annie Spiro, Friend of the Bride.</b> Annie and I met with a simple smile in freshman gym class. With one look at this girl, I knew she was my kind of people. We have grown up together, helping each other figure out whom we are. We also have wicked fun, since we have a very similar sense of humor! She's always been a great friend. </p>
		  
          <h3>Best Man</h3>
          <p><b>Johnathan Chung, Brother of the Groom.</b>  My brother has been both my oldest playmate and my most supportive and loyal friend.  Whether playing "the carpet is lava", G.I. Joes versus Battle Beasts, Super Mario Bros., Halo, Rock Band, or Mahjong -- we've had great times together through the years.  I know I can count on his honest and educated opinions, steadfast support, and love.</p>
		  
          <h3>Groomsmen</h3>
          <p><b>Aaron TenHarmsel, Friend of the Groom.</b> Aaron and I met at an indoor climbing competition and instantly became friends.  We would travel to climb in Kentucky, outdoor competitions in the Southeast, or just good ol' bouldering trips to places like Hueco Tanks. Aaron helped introduce me to photography, and he continues to be a creative inspiration for me.  When Aaron needed an apartment closer to medical school, I offered him my second bedroom. That time we spent as roommates strengthened our friendship. I know that I can always count on Aaron for advice, grounded only in what matters.</p>
          <p><b>Roger Huang, Friend of the Groom.</b> Neither Roger nor I have any recollection of how or when we met, but that didn't prevent us from becoming great friends.  We've spent much time together climbing in various climbing gyms, camping and climbing in Kentucky, ice climbing on the U.P., running up long Alpine routes, and learning to respect (and fear) 5.8+.  I know that I can count on Roger to hang out and for his willingness to try something new.</p>
